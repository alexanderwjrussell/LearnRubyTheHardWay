CALLING AND USING CHECKLIST:

Did you call/use/run this function by typing its name?
Did you put the ( character after the name to run it?
Did you put the values you want into the parenthesis separated by commas?
Did you end the function call with a ) character?
Functions that don't have parameters do not need the () after them, but would it be clearer if you wrote them anyway?
